// nearest palette color is unsound: a mid-grey blend of black and white can
// be nearer (by any global color metric) to an unrelated third palette
// color - e.g. a warm amber - than it is to either endpoint of the blend,
// because neither endpoint IS amber. The result is thin ribbons of the
// wrong color traced along every edge in the image.
//
// The fix: label only pixels that are confidently close to a real
// palette/background color, leave everything else explicitly unresolved
// ("fringe"), then grow the confident labels into the fringe by iterated
// 8-neighbor majority vote - each fringe pixel ends up taking the label of
// whichever real region it actually borders, rather than the globally
// nearest (but locally wrong) palette color.
//
// "Confident" is deliberately about *closeness to a real color*, not about
// how much closer the nearest candidate is than the second-nearest: an
// anti-aliased blend pixel can be closer to the wrong color by a wide
// margin (as in the amber example above), so a top-2-ambiguity test
// wouldn't catch it. Anything not genuinely close to some real reference
// color falls back to its plain nearest-color label - which is also what
// keeps continuous-tone/photo input sane and fast (see MAX_FRINGE_FRACTION

// of course, not because they're edge artefacts, so they should just take

// tags on `<g>` elements through paper.js's SVG import (see
// classifyWithFringeResolution's callers and combineGrayscaleLevels in
// main.ts). Any element's `data-paper-data` is parsed into that item's
// `.data` on import - the root `<svg>` tag works exactly the same way a
// `<g>` does.
//
// This makes the field available, once per vectorize() call, to
// generateInfills (infill.ts) later on: the imported root item stays
// mounted in the paper.js project tree across the whole render, so
// infill.ts can find this tag by walking `paper.project` without needing
// the raster (or this SVG's root item) threaded through any function
// signature - `generatePaths` (generator.ts) only ever propagates the
// existing density/outline/colorIndex/spacingMm tags down onto individual
// paths, so putting this on the root instead of on (or under) a path is
// what keeps it intact and keeps it a single copy rather than duplicated
// onto every traced path.
//
// Every raster-origin vectorize() output (single-mask, grayscale, and
// color/k-means) is expected to route through this before being posted
// back to the client - see main.ts. Vector-origin SVGs (path-tracing mode,
// which never calls vectorize() at all) never get this tag, which is
