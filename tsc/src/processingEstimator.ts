// traced paths at shapeCount in {2,4,7,10,13} (tsc/bench/runBenchmarks.js's
// benchFlatten), fit by least-squares through the origin against
// shapeCount^2. Previous value (25) was ~11x too low.
//
// SHAPE COUNT vs SHAPE COMPLEXITY - measured residual, deliberately left
// unmodelled: this coefficient (and the shapeCount^2 formula generally)
// only knows shape *count*, not shape *complexity*. A raster
// color-separation mask traced from a detailed image (e.g. a busy cartoon)
// can come back as ONE compound path per color with thousands of internal
// sub-loops from Potrace - the real per-layer shape count is 1, while
// estimateShapeCount() projects tens of shapes from pixel count and
// complexity. The formula therefore gets the right magnitude for the wrong
// reason on these inputs.
//
// History: this section previously recorded a 3-14 SECOND real cost on
// Bluey_Hero.png (500px, 300mm, 2-4 colors, cross-layer knockout), three
// to four orders of magnitude past what the formula predicted, and blamed
// shape complexity inside paper.js's boolean subtract. That diagnosis was
// wrong. The cost was in src/geometry/offset.ts's clipperSolutionToPathItem,
// which reassembled Clipper's offset solution with one paper.js boolean op
// per ring against a growing accumulator; it is fixed (commit 2a0cbbd) by
// handing the rings straight to a CompoundPath.
//
// RE-MEASURED 2026-08-18, same machine and inputs, after that fix
// (tsc/bench/runBenchmarks.ts's benchKnockout, deviceFactor ~1.01):
//   colors   real knockout delta   this model predicts   residual
//     2            0.85 s                0.45 s           +0.40 s

// (was 3.2 / 8.2 / 15.0 s real before the offset.ts fix.) The model now
// under-predicts by under 2x and by under 0.6 s absolute - in line with the
// other stages' fit error, not an outlier.
//
// MEASURED DEAD END, do not re-propose: decomposing the operands so
// flattener.ts subtracts sub-path against sub-path instead of whole
// compound against whole compound. Prototyped and timed: decomposing both
// operands into proper disjoint components (outer ring plus its contained
// holes) and pruning pairs by bounding box prunes 97.7% of pairs (183 of
// 7930 survive on the heaviest real pair), and the areas match exactly - so
// it is correct, just slower. The 183 surviving subtracts cost 819 ms plus
// 43 ms to decompose, against 634 ms for the single whole-compound
// subtract: 0.7x. paper.js's boolean carries enough fixed per-call cost
// that its own whole-compound handling beats N small ones.
//
// The other candidate - threading a post-vectorize complexity signal (real
// traced sub-path/point count, available right after vectorizeImageDataColor)
// into the estimate - is NOT worth the plumbing at these numbers. It would
// buy at most the sub-second residual above, and it would have to arrive
// after vectorize, whereas this estimator runs strictly before any tracing
// (main.ts's 'estimate' message carries only the raw raster, so the user
// sees the number before committing to a render). Paying for it means
// splitting the estimate into a pre- and post-vectorize phase across the

//   - spiral: point-sampling + path.contains() tests along one continuous
//     curve - broadly similar per-unit-length cost to a hatch line's own
//     clip test, no grid setup.
//   - gradientHatch: BY FAR the most expensive per unit - each seed walks a
//     multi-step streamline, resampling the gradient field and testing
//     containment at every step (fillStrategies/streamline.ts), on top of
//     the one-time Sobel pass (imageGradient.ts) amortized elsewhere.
//   - contour: Clipper integer-polygon offsetting per ring
//     (fillStrategies/contour.ts) - general polygon-offset math, the next
//     most expensive strategy after gradientHatch.

// being dominated by each strategy's own fixed per-call setup cost (grid
// construction, Clipper initialization, etc.) - see this constant's
// section in the harness/PR notes for the full per-strategy ratio table.
// At very low segment counts (a handful of segments on a small/simple
// shape) that fixed setup cost can dominate the *absolute* time (tens of
