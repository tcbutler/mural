// --- colorCount -----------------------------------------------------
//
// Flat/vector-ish art: its own estimatedDistinctColors is a direct, honest
// count of how many pens a human would actually reach for - just clamp it
// into a sane pen-budget range. Continuous-tone/photographic content has no
// natural "true" color count (it's a gradient, not discrete regions), so a
// fixed richer range that scales with how continuous-tone the image reads
// gives k-means enough pens to approximate shading via hue-grouped
// hatching (huePalette.ts) without asking for more physical pens than a
// typical user owns.

    // gets the full range for smoother tonal gradation.

    );
}

// --- fillStrategy -----------------------------------------------------
//
// Flat art wants a clean, predictable, cheap fill - crossHatch45 is the
// well-tested default and reads well on solid regions. Continuous-tone
// content benefits from gradientHatch's engraving-style directional
// hatching (fillStrategies/gradientHatch.ts), which follows the image's
// own local tonal gradient instead of a fixed angle - but only once the
// image is confidently continuous-tone; a borderline image gets the safer,
// cheaper crossHatch45 rather than paying gradientHatch's much higher
// processing cost for a marginal visual gain (see processingEstimator.ts's
// per-strategy cost table).

        'crossHatch45',
        'This looks flat/vector-ish (or only mildly continuous-tone), so the standard cross-hatch fill is the cheapest choice that will look clean.',
    );
}

// --- infillDensity ------------------------------------------------------
//
// Flat art with a small number of solid colors reads fine at a moderate
// density (level 3) - there's no fine tonal gradation to preserve, so
// there's little benefit to a denser hatch. Continuous-tone content needs
// denser hatching (finer spacing) to have enough tonal resolution for
// shading to read smoothly, scaling up with how strongly continuous-tone
// the image is.

}

// --- turdSize (despeckle) ------------------------------------------------
//
// Potrace's turdSize (vectorizer.ts's vectorizeImageData) drops
// traced regions below this pixel-area threshold - useful for suppressing
// noise, harmful if it eats real fine detail. Flat art has clean, deliberate
// edges (edgeFraction is a real signal, not noise), so a small threshold is
// safe. Continuous-tone/photographic content - especially with visible
// texture/edge activity - is much more likely to trace a lot of true noise
// (JPEG artifacts, film grain, sensor noise) as tiny spurious regions, so a
// higher threshold scaled by edgeFraction cleans that up.
function recommendTurdSize(characteristics: ImageCharacteristics): Recommendation<number> {

        return recommend(2, 'Flat art has clean, deliberate edges, so a small despeckle threshold is enough to drop stray single-pixel noise without losing real detail.');

        value,
        'Continuous-tone/photographic sources often trace a lot of sensor/compression noise as tiny spurious regions, so a higher despeckle threshold cleans that up.',
    );
}

// --- hueGrouping ----------------------------------------------------------
//
// Hue-grouping (huePalette.ts) collapses several detected shades of one hue
// onto a single physical pen, drawn at different hatch densities. That's
// exactly what continuous-tone content needs (many close, related shades)
// and actively unhelpful for flat art, where each detected color is
// usually already meant to be visually distinct (collapsing them would
// merge colors the source image deliberately kept separate).
function recommendHueGrouping(characteristics: ImageCharacteristics): Recommendation<boolean> {
    if (characteristics.classification === 'flat') {
        return recommend(false, 'Flat art\'s colors are usually deliberately distinct, so grouping by hue would merge colors that should stay separate.');
