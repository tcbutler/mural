# Motion smoothing (`-DMURAL_SMOOTH_MOTION`)

**Status: implemented but UNTESTED ON REAL HARDWARE.** The code behind
`#ifdef MURAL_SMOOTH_MOTION` (in `src/runner.cpp`) is marked with a comment
saying so.

## What this does

Nothing when the flag is off - the code is fully `#ifdef`-guarded out, so
default builds are unaffected.

When on: the drawing command file (`/commands`, produced by the `tsc`
toolchain) is a sequence of `x y` waypoints (plus pen up/down commands).
Normally `Runner::getNextTask()` turns every waypoint into its own
`InterpolatingMovementTask`, and `Runner::run()` only starts the next task
once the current one has fully finished - i.e. once both motors have reached
`distanceToGo() == 0` and stopped. That happens at *every* waypoint, even
when a straight line in the source SVG got flattened into several nearly
collinear waypoints in a row, each one triggering a real stop-and-restart of
both motors (`acceleration` in `movement.h` is "essentially infinite", i.e.
this is an instant velocity change, not a ramp).

With the flag on, `Runner::getNextTask()` looks ahead in the file: as long as
the next waypoint keeps the path nearly straight (the turn angle at the
previous waypoint is below `smoothAngleThresholdRad`, 3 degrees by default),
it's folded into the *same* task by extending that task's target, and the
Runner never sees that intermediate waypoint as a task boundary. Only when
the turn angle exceeds the threshold does a new task actually start, causing
a real stop. This reuses `InterpolatingMovementTask`'s existing 1mm
interpolation unchanged - it already interpolates in a straight line from the
current position to whatever target it's given - so this is a change to
*which* points are used as task boundaries, not to the interpolation itself.

## Tuning

- `smoothAngleThresholdRad` in `src/runner.cpp` (default `3.0 * PI / 180.0`,
  i.e. 3 degrees): the maximum turn angle between two consecutive segments
  that's still treated as "collinear enough" to merge. Larger = smoother
  motion but more corner-cutting (the merged path is a straight line between
  the endpoints, skipping the exact original waypoints in between, so real
  corners near the threshold will visibly get rounded off). Smaller = more
  faithful to the original path but less smoothing benefit.

## Known limitation (resolved)

This previously under-reported progress, because progress was
`executedLines / totalLines` and the peek loop consumes waypoints without
incrementing `executedLines` - a merged run of five collinear waypoints
advanced the counter by one while eating five lines' worth of the total.

Progress is now time-weighted (`completedSeconds / totalEstimatedSeconds`, see
`Runner::computePercent`), and the per-task cost is computed *after* the merge:

```cpp
targetPosition = mergedTarget;
...
pendingTaskSeconds = estimateSegmentSeconds(previousTarget, targetPosition, pen->isDown());
```

So a merged task is costed by its full merged distance, and the pre-scan total
is unaffected because merging does not change the path length (the merged
segment runs straight between endpoints that were already nearly collinear).
`executedLines` still under-counts, but it is now only reported alongside the
percentage rather than being the source of it.

## Safe first test

1. Build with `pio run -e esp32dev-smooth` and confirm it compiles (this has
   been done - see the PR/commit this doc ships with).
2. Before running a real drawing, do a short test file with a few nearly
   straight lines and a few sharp corners, and visually confirm on the bench
   that: straight-ish runs move smoothly without visible per-mm hesitation,
   and sharp corners still stop and change direction correctly (i.e. the
   angle threshold is actually being respected, not merging things it
   shouldn't).
3. Compare the drawn output against the same file with the flag off to make
   sure the corner-cutting at `smoothAngleThresholdRad` is visually
   acceptable at the scale you draw at. If not, lower the threshold.

## Building

```
pio run -e esp32dev-smooth
```

This environment (`platformio.ini`) adds `-DMURAL_SMOOTH_MOTION` on top of
the default `esp32dev` environment. No new library dependencies.
